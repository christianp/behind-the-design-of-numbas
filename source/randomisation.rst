Randomising questions
=====================

Problem
-------

Want to randomise questions, so that some aspects are different for each student.

Randomised mathematical expressions can look odd.

Many common patterns:

* scenarios
* "random except for x"
* generate a set of values satisfying a condition

Solution
--------

Define a list of variables, with implicit references between them.

Try to provide functions for common tasks.

Often, working backwards from a randomly-chosen result works better.
