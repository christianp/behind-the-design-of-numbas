Writing style for questions

Problem
-------

What's the right way to write questions?

How wordy? How formal?

Things to pay attention to:

* Representation and equity issues, e.g. named people; cultural assumptions.
* Assumptions about student's knowledge, particularly if not directly relevant to what's being assessed.
* Accessibility, e.g. text descriptions of graphics; use of colour; long-winded sentences.
* Fake context.

When do illustrations help? Must illustrations only be used to provide information?

Do students have assumptions about the structure of a question? Does it help to impose one?
