Problem
-------

Have a common assessment task that isn't covered by the built-in part types.

Want to customise the input method and/or the marking algorithm.

Should be reusable but configurable.

Solution
--------

A custom part type is:

* A list of settings for question authors to configure behaviour.
* An input method.
* A marking algorithm.
