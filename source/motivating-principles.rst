Motivating principles
=====================

These are the motivating principles behind Numbas.

Design
------

* Find common patterns in question authoring, and come up with the right level of abstraction to accommodate them.

* Where possible, provide the author with choices rather than requiring scripting.

* Allow rapid iteration - show the consequences of an editing action immediately.

* Allow extension.

* Low barrier to entry.

Use
---


* Initially summative, replacing handwritten homework, then formative (in maths)

* Persistent demand for e-assessment in service courses.
  They're seen as easier to assess, because there's less demand on deep understanding.

* In maths, trying to move to exploration - not really assessment at all.

* Is the printed worksheet theme under-used?

* In labs, for recording measurements and assessing calculations.
