Extensions
==========

Problem
-------

Maths is huge.
How to work in a field not covered by the built-ins?

Might need to add:

* JME functions
* data types
* part types
* page elements
* data sets

Don't want to define this each time it's used: Don't Repeat Yourself.

Solution
--------

Extensions framework adds stuff through JavaScript.

Custom part types make marking algorithms reusable and provide a nice authoring interface.
