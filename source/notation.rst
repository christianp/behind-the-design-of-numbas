Parsing mathematical notation
=============================

.. page_status::
    :kind: outline

Problem
-------

Mathematical notation is not rigorously defined, and contains many ambiguities and inconsistencies.

Valid notation depends on context.

Want to specify allowed notation, and accept many conventions.

Should provide good feedback for invalid input.

What's the best input method? Linear plain text? WYSIWYG? 

Solution
--------

Plain text input.

Abstracted parser.

"Expand juxtapositions" routines.

Still much to do.
