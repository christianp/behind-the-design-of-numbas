Simplifying mathematical expressions
====================================

Problem
-------

Randomised mathematical expressions usually need some rearrangement, which a human would do automatically.

"Simplification" is not a uniquely-defined task: depends on context.

Solution
--------

Rewrite rules defined using :ref:`pattern-matching`.

Configurable sets of rules.

Repeatedly apply rules until none match.

Need to ensure that there are no loops - the simplification process converges.
