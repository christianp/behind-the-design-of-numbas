Writing Numbas questions
========================

Problem
-------

How should an author write a Numbas question?

* as a program
* as a declarative structure

* in a text file
* in a graphical editor

What feedback is useful?

What should the documentation look like?

Solution
--------

Web-based editor, creating a declarative document with occasional code sections.

Lots of immediate feedback for:

* invalid inputs
* generated values

Links to follow cross-references.

Links to documentation next to each editable field.
